# Example - Amsterdam Experiments

This repository contains an example of a Helm Chart template and GitHub Actions, similar to what you will use during the experiment.

In this repository, you can run GitHub Actions to analyze a chart template and later evaluate the results. 

From this repository, you can download all the files that you may need (e.g., original chart template, scanning results, etc.), and further analyze them locally.
